/*
Bridge (Structural): You get a call from Ms.Masaba Gupta of Bangalore Decathlon
office that there is a policy decision made globally to introduce discount
slabs for a whole month twice in a year. The discount month will be in January
and July after reviewing the sales made from Feb to June (first five months)
and Aug to December (last five months) respectively. It is decided to provide
four slabs of discounts in 2017, namely, 30%, 25%, 20% and 15%, based on the
sports item purchased. For e.g. all tennis rackets could have a 20% discount
while cricket bats could only have a 15% discount. All exercise tread-mills
could be given a 30% discount while boxing-gloves could have a 25% discount.
Point to be noted here is that, the slabs of discount may not remain the same
in 2018. It is likely to vary year after year. The ‘Decathlon POS’ software
system classifies its customers as Senior-Citizens (60 and above), First-Time
Customers, Regular Customers as of now. There is a very high possibility that
the Customer Type hierarchy will vary, depending upon the sales-pattern. For
e.g. there could be the need to introduce new categories based on the customer
gender.
Use the Bridge Pattern to design & implement, so that both the Customer Type
hierarchy of classes as well as the Discount Percentage hierarchy of classes
can both vary independently? That is, they are not tied to each other.
